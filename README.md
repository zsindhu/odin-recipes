<!--HTML Project - Odin Project

I learned how to setup an HTML boilerplate which is the infrastructure needed to code in HTML. For example, setting the parameters to english and accounting for special symbols through UTF-8. I worked with how to add text. The different header sizes (1-6). The use of paragraphs. Making lists, both ordered and unordered. Using absoulte and relative links for different pages and images. 

This is a project encapsulating everything I've learned in the HTML section of the Odin Project mentioned above. I'll be creating a website, which includes my favorite recipes.-->
